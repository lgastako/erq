- Figure out why the first connection after a restart fails.  WTF?
- Get protocol working identically to kestrel so I can test against both.
  - So far so good.
- Implement persistence via amnesia.
- Implement all the goofy extensions that Robey implemented.
- Implement any applicable config options from Kestrel.
